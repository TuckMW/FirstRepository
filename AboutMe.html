      Hello, my name is Tucker Webb. I am currently still a high school student taking various college classes. I do not have any recent pictures of myself, so the picture of me on the right is a few years old. I plan to be going somewhere in the engineering field, specifically regarding computers. I am taking this class because if I were to go into that field, I feel like this class would be important for me in the future. Also, I am really interested in computer science regardless because I have multiple friends also studying it.
